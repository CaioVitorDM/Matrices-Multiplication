# THIS IS A CODING EXERCISE FOR THE IMD0036 CLASS
- This was made using C++.

- There are three Programs, one using the logic of a process for each element in the
resultant matrix, one the logic of a process for each line in the resultant matrix and one using
a sequential form, following natural programming logic.

- The goal of this exercise is to show the difference between the three forms and the gains using paralel 
programming when you scale those matrices orders.

- To compile use g++ -o ```executable name``` -std=c++17 ```program name.cpp```

- To run use ./program-name  ```number-of-rows-of-A```  ```number-of-cols-of-A```  ```number-of-rows-of-B```  ```number-of-cols-of-B```
